# Password Generator 

## Challenge 3: Create a functional password generating website with user choices supplied to create the output.  

## Built with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### This project began with supplied HTML and CSS files to create a framework for the website and a limited amount of JavaScript.

My job on this project is to write JS code to initiate a generated password from a set of choices for the user. The user should choose a password length within the given range and choose whether or not to include uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numeric characters and/or special charatcters.

I began my work on this project by adding pseudocode via //comments to organize my thoughts and give the page some basic structure. As my research into the project progressed, I updated my final product with these newly learned ways of improvement.
This project features code to prompt the user for the desired password length and which character sets they would like included in their password.  It is also coded to ensure valid input.
